# Warm Start Conference

**Warm Start** is a serverless conference experience for beginners.

It's more than a just another tech conference. A team of experienced speakers & mentors will help you with:

- Writing the *call for papers* (CFP).
- Giving tips on creating slides & demos.
- Practicing your session during a *dry run*.

The goal is to get you comfortable and well prepared for giving your first 10 minute session at our conference.
