# Warm Start Conference

**Warm Start** is a serverless conference experience for beginners.

It's more than a just another tech conference. A team of experienced speakers & mentors will help you with:

- Writing the *call for papers* (CFP).
- Giving tips on creating slides & demos.
- Practicing your session during a *dry run*.

The goal is to get you comfortable and well prepared for giving your first 10 minute session at our conference.

## Target Audience

### The speakers we're looking for

We're looking for people, especially from underrepresented groups, who are new to speaking and a tiny bit of serverless experience.

### The conference audience we have in mind

We expect people with little to no experience with serverless and who are very curious to learn from their peers.

## Code of Conduct
